# CLIP-Novelty-Detection-For-Bird-Species
This repo is a project that is trying to make AI models that are capable of detecting unseen categories (specifically we are using cub -200-2011 dataset of 200 bird species and training the model only on 150 bird species and 50 bird species are novel )that they never seen in the training .
